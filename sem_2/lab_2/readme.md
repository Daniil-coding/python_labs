# Plotting and root search

Application for creating a plot of a function on the defined interval.

Input:<br>
    function expression<br>
    left and right bounds of the interval<br>
    accuracy of calculating the root<br>
    greatest iteration count for root search

Splits the interval into sections using fixed step size and tries to calculate a root<br>
within every section (binary search).<br>
The same thing with extremums and inflections.

Able to draw a plot with indication of roots, extremums and inflections.<br>
Able to build a table with information about roots of the function.
